    <h1>The Special Bond Between</h1>
    <h1>the Isle of Skye, the MacKinnon Clan and Drambuie</h1>
        <p>
        The intent of this website is to offer a creative and informative website about the Isle of Skye which not only inspires travel to Skye but promotes a genuine passion and appreciation for the beauty and heritage of all things Skye, MacKinnon and Drambuie related.
        </p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.isleofskye.com/">
        The Isle of Skye<a/>, fondly referred to as Skye, is an island off the West Coast of Scotland's Highlands in the United Kingdom of Great Britain.  It boasts some of the most breathtaking Highland landscapes imaginable.
        Across Skye youâ€™ll find precarious peaks, jutting ridges, imposing pinnacles and sweeping glens which are nothing short of majestic. Skye is one of the top locations in Scotland to visit.  And has been the site of many feature films, from big-budget blockbusters to critically-acclaimed arthouse productions. It is also one of the most popular photographic locations in the world!  And people travel from all over the world with their cameras to capture the beauty and drama of the island's landscapes and wildlife.
        </p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.themackinnon.com/history.html"> MacKinnon</a> Clan can date it's history on the Isle of Skye from the 14th century until the 18th century. The MacKinnons famously gave shelter to King Robert the Bruce, a national hero for leading Scotland during its first war of independence from England at the Battle of Bannockburn in June 1314. In return, he rewarded them with land on the Isle of Skye. Skye is rich with MacKinnon history, despite the fact that they lost their ancestral lands after the clans were defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.
        </p>
        <p>And what is that special bond between
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drambuie"> Drambuie</a>, the MacKinnon clan and Skye?  Legend has it that Prince Charles Edward Stuart  -known as "Bonnie Prince Charlie"-  gave the MacKinnons his prized, secret recipe for a Scottish Whiskey  -now known as Drambuie-  in exchange for sanctuary given to him on the Isle of Skye by Captain John MacKinnon of Clan MacKinnon after the Battle of Culloden in 1746.
